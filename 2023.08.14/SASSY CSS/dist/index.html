            To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time
            <br>
            <br>
            Robert Herrick
            <br>
            <br>
            Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,
            <br>
            Old time is still a-flying:
            <br>
            And this same flower that smiles today,
            <br>
            Tomorrow will be dying.
            <br>
            <br>
            The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,
            <br>
            The higher he’s a-getting,
            <br>
            The sooner will his race be run,
            <br>
            And nearer he’s to setting.
            <br>
            <br>
            That age is best which is the first,
            <br>
            When youth and blood are warmer;
            <br>
            But being spent, the worse, and worst
            <br>
            Times still succeed the former.
            <br>
            <br>
            Then be not coy, but use your time;
            <br>
            And while ye may, go marry:
            <br>
            For having lost but once your prime,
            <br>
            You may for ever tarry.

            How Do I Love Thee?
            <br>
            <br>
            Elizabeth Barrett Browning
            <br>
            <br>
            How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
            <br>
            I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
            <br>
            My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
            <br>
            For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.
            <br>
            <br>
            I love thee to the level of everyday's
            <br>
            Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.
            <br>
            I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;
            <br>
            I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.
            <br>
            <br>
            I love thee with the passion put to use
            <br>
            In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
            <br>
            I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
            <br>
            With my lost saints, - I love thee with the breath,
            <br>
            Smiles, tears, of all my life! - and, if God choose,
            <br>
            I shall but love thee better after death.

            Hope is the thing with feathers
            <br>
            <br>
            Emily Dickinson
            <br>
            <br>
            Hope is the thing with feathers
            <br>
            That perches in the soul,
            <br>
            And sings the tune without the words,
            <br>
            And never stops at all,
            <br>
            <br>
            And sweetest in the gale is heard;
            <br>
            And sore must be the storm
            <br>
            That could abash the little bird
            <br>
            That kept so many warm.
            <br>
            <br>
            I've heard it in the chillest land,
            <br>
            And on the strangest sea;
            <br>
            Yet, never, in extremity,
            <br>
            It asked a crumb of me.
